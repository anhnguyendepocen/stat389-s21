\textbf{Format:} \vspace{6pt}

The course will be taught remotely over Zoom. During the first week of the
semester students will be placed into groups of around 3 people each. Students
may self-select their own groups. A large portion of the course work will be
done using break-out groups within these teams. Materials and assignments for
the class will be posted on the course website. All assignments will be
submitted through shared Google Drive folders.

\vspace{12pt}

\textbf{Class Components:} \vspace{6pt}

Course meetings will typically start with a short introduction to a new topic.
We will then use breakout rooms to split into groups. Each group will then
collectively work through questions posed as a R markdown notebook, or make
progress towards the next group project. Teams will work together by picking a
`driver' (which should alternate between classes) to share their screen and
take notes or write/run code.

\vspace{12pt}

\textbf{Projects:} \vspace{6pt}

The core output of the course will be the completion of five projects. These
will be assigned throughout the course of the semester and focus on the
application of the course material to various textual corpora. Projects will
be completed together in your class group. There will usually be plenty of
class time to work on each project. We will also have time to present a subset
of the projects to the rest of the class. Tentative due-dates and topics are
posted on the course website and will be updated as needed.

\vspace{12pt}

\textbf{Attendence:} \vspace{6pt}

Given the amount of group-work required during the course meetings, it is
important for everyone to make an attempt to attend every class. With the
exception of extended absenses due to serious illness or family emergencies,
students will recieve a reduction in their final grade (including the
possibility of a failing grade) after missing more than two class meetings.

\vspace{12pt}

\textbf{Grades:} \vspace{6pt}

Each group's project will be graded as either Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory,
along with extensive constructive feedback. At the end of the semester, each
student will individually submit a self-assessment of their work in the course,
how they contributed to each project, and what they have learned during the
semester.\\

All students who have earned satisfactory grades on the five projects, and
missed no more than two classes, will earn a grade of at least a B+. Grades of
B+, A-, A, and A+ will be given according to each student's self-assessment in
light of their projects and course participation.

\vspace{12pt}

\textbf{Getting Help:} \vspace{6pt}

Given social distancing rules, I find the easiest way to answer questions
is by finding time after our scheduled class meeting times. I will always make
a habit of staying after class as long as students have questions. There will
also be office hours the evening before projects are due in case of last minute
questions. Finally, if you have extended questions, personal concerns, or are
unable to meet on either side of the class meeeting, please feel free to email
me or ask in class for a dedicated appointment.
