	Abstract = {The recent interest in sensor networks has led to a number of routing schemes that use the limited resources available at sensor nodes more efficiently. These schemes typically try to find the minimum energy path to optimize energy usage at a node. In this paper we take the view that always using lowest energy paths may not be optimal from the point of view of network lifetime and long-term connectivity. To optimize these measures, we propose a new scheme called energy aware routing that uses sub-optimal paths occasionally to provide substantial gains. Simulation results are also presented that show increase in network lifetimes of up to 40\% over comparable schemes like directed diffusion routing. Nodes also burn energy in a more equitable way across the network ensuring a more graceful degradation of service with time.},

	Abstract = {The Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT) is a key element of many signal processing and communication tasks. Many recent applications involve distributed signal processing, where it is not generally possible to apply the KLT to the entire signal; rather, the KLT must be approximated in a distributed fashion. This paper investigates such distributed approaches to the KLT, where several distributed terminals observe disjoint subsets of a random vector.},
