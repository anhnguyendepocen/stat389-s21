# The R Programming Language

---

# What is R

R is an open-source programming language focused on data analysis. It is
a very popular language in academia, industry, and government work. Typically
somewhere in the top-20 most popular programming languages (TIOBE: 8th, GitHub:
12th, StackOverflow: 16th).

R is also a relatively old language. It was first developed under the name "S"
at Bell Labs by Rick Becker, John Chambers, and Alan Wilks in 1976. The language
was originally closed-source, prompting Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman to
develop and free, open-source reimplementation of the language in 1993.

# Components

It will be helpful to understand some of the components of the software we will
be using this semester. There are three different things that are needed, all
of which are provided as free and open-source software:

1. The core R programming language itself.
2. RStudio: an additional piece of software that provides tools for writing R
code (i.e., an integrated development environment).
3. Additional third-party extensions to R known as *packages*.

---

# Options

You have two options for working with R this semester. You can either install
it on your own computer, or use a cloud-based service that the university has
bought for this academic year.

Based on experience last semester, I strongly recommend trying to set up R on
your own machine first. You can fall back to the cloud-based option in the
event of any difficulties.

# Local Setup (recommended)

# Local Setup (recommended)

Some students may choose to run RStudio locally on their own machine rather than logging
into RStudio cloud. This is perfectly fine, and does have several advantages: will work
after the end of the semester, no need to internet access, and may be faster if you have
a newer laptop.

Note, however, that I will not be able to offer much technical support for alternative
setups. I recommend setting up RStudio Cloud even if you intend to work locally in case
you run into software problems later on. This is particularly true for students running
Windows, which may run into unique errors during some of the later lessons on web scraping
and text analysis.

# Local Setup (recommended)

In order to setup the course materials locally you should:

1. Install the [R programming language](https://cran.r-project.org/) language from CRAN.
2. Install [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
3. Download and uncompress the zip file from the course website.
4. Open the file `setup.R` in RStudio and run both chunks of code. Note that you may
need to open the Console at the bottom and respond to a question about updating packages
(you probably want to answer "yes").

Now you can open the other notebooks just as we are doing on RStudio Cloud.

# RStudio Cloud

# RStudio Cloud Setup

Now, let's see how to setup RStudio Cloud. This should be a relatively
straightforward process:

1. Click on the RStudio Cloud link at the top of the course website.
2. This will open a login page. Assuming you do not yet have an account, click
on the sign up link and create one with your `richmond.edu` email address.
3. Pick a username, which can be anything you would like.
4. After signing in, you should be prompted to "Join Space". Select yes.
5. Now, click on the projects and select the button next to "Introduction Data
Science" to create your own version of the course notes.

If you get stuck at any point with these steps, I suggest going back to the
course website and clicking on the RStudio Cloud link again. Sometimes after
creating a new account in does not re-direct you at first to the course website.

---

# RStudio Cloud Setup

You should now have a new project created that contains some starter code. This
is where we will start most classes going forward. For the rest of today's notes
we will walk through an introduction to R using the first notebook.

In the future, you should be able to return to this screen by clicking on the
RStudio Cloud link on the website and logging in.
