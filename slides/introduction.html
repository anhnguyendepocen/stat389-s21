# Welcome!

Welcome to Statistical Learning!

Today we are going to go through a few notes, which give a long-form version of
the posted syllabus. We will then walk through setting up the software we will
be using throughout the semester.

You should feel free to ask questions at any point during the semester. Please
either (i) use the Zoom raise hand feature, (ii) post your question or just a
question mark in the chat window, or (iii) wait for a pause and shout out
directly.

---

# Website

We will get to all of the course details soon. Before that, as reminder from my
emails to the class, all of the materials for the course can be found on the
course website:

- https://statsmaths.github.io/stat389-s21/index.html

Make sure to bookmark this somewhere easy to access. The page will remain
online indefinitely for your reference following the semester.

# Part 2: Course Content

# What Is "Learning"?

Statistical learning, synonymous with machine learning, is the process
of extracting knowledge from data automatically, usually with the goal
of making predictions on new, unseen data.

A classical example is a spam filter, for which the user keeps labelling
incoming mails as either spam or not spam. A machine learning algorithm
then "learns" a predictive model from data that distinguishes spam from
normal emails, a model which can predict for new emails whether they
are spam or not.

---

# Further Examples

- using physical characteristics of animals to predict whether
they are carnivores
- estimate how much a house is worth given properties such as
number of bedrooms, square footage and its address
- predict whether a flight will be delayed given the carrier,
scheduled departure time, arrival and departure airports
- a crime has been reported at a specific place and time in
Chicago; what type of crime is it?
- here is a picture of a flower, what kind of flower is it?
- given two sentences of text, predict which President used it
in a public speech
- how many page views will a specific Wikipedia page receive
tomorrow?

# What we will cover

This class is not about teaching you a wide range of models, nor is it
really about the study of models in the first place. Rather, I want you
to learn how we can use learning algorithms to study complex datasets.

To this end, we are going to focus specifically on the the analysis of
textual data with the use of statistical learning algorithms. The course
will start with a few weeks of material that introduce the core concepts,
and then we will move toward applying them to several different textual
corpora. Along the way, additional topics in text analysis will be explored.

To things we will not do much of: (1) using neural networks or other
deep learning algoriths, or (2) discussing much about the theory behind
the methods. For either of these, I would be happy to refer you to a
number of excellent and free online resources.

# Prerequisites and MATH289

This course is designed to be the second set of a sequence formed with
MATH289. I will assume that everyone is familiar with the core ideas from
that class about running code in R, producing data visualizations and
making arguments about data. However, this semester this is not a strict
prerequisite (it will be next year). I have put together notes linked to
this course as a way of catching up if you are coming from another programming
language or need a refresh of the concepts.

# Part 3: Format

---

# Online Format

Due to social distancing guidelines and the need to maximize flexibility, this
course is being taught using online instruction. Classes will be presented
remotely over Zoom. A link to the Zoom room is provided on the course website.
A numeric password was sent via email to the class roster.

The course has been designed so that only minimal changes will be needed in the
event that some or all students need to return home before the normal end of
the semester.

---

# Course Format

Most class meetings will consist of a short presentation of some new concepts,
followed by breaking out into groups to either work through a set of applied
data analysis questions or to start working on the next project.

Students are not allowed to record the text or video of the class without prior
permission. When permission is granted, recordings must not be shared and shall
be destroyed at the end of the semester.

---

# Groups

During the first week of the semester students will be organized into groups
of around 3 people each. A large portion of the course work will be done using
break-out groups within these teams.

I plan to share Google Drive folder with each group to facilitate sharing and
submitting materials.

---

# Projects

The core output of the course will be the completion of five projects. These
will be assigned throughout the course of the semester and focus on the
application of the course material to various textual corpora. Projects will
be completed together in your class group. There will usually be plenty of
class time to work on each project. We will also have time to present a subset
of the projects to the rest of the class. Tentative due-dates and topics are
posted on the course website and will be updated as needed.

---

# Grades

Each group's project will be graded as either Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory,
along with extensive constructive feedback. At the end of the semester, each
student will individually submit a self-assessment of their work in the course,
how they contributed to each project, and what they have learned during the
semester.

All students who have earned satisfactory grades on the five projects, and
missed no more than two classes, will earn a grade of at least a B+. Grades of
B+, A-, A, and A+ will be given according to each student's self-assessment in
light of their projects and course participation.

---

# Attendance Policies

Given the amount of group-work required during the course meetings, it is
important for everyone to make an attempt to attend every class. With the
exception of extended absenses due to serious illness or family emergencies,
students will recieve a reduction in their final grade (including the
possibility of a failing grade) after missing more than two class meetings.

---

# Zoom policies

Please follow the following policies when joining the group office hours and
course meetings:

- Use your UR Zoom login account.
- Camera is optional when we are meeting as a whole class. I appreciate having
it on for office hours and when in break-out rooms.
- Be prepared to share screen if called on.

If you have any concerns about any of these items, please let me know.

---

# Special Circumstances

I completely understand that extenuating circumstances may arise throughout the
semester that effect your ability to attend class or follow along with the pace
of the course. Please contact me as soon as possible so that we can find the
best path forward.

---

# Office Hours

Given social distancing rules, I find the easiest way to answer questions
is by finding time before, during, or after our scheduled class meeting times.
I will always make a habit of staying after class as long as students have
questions. If you want to meet right before class, just let me know.
If you have extended questions, personal concerns, or are unable to meet on
either side of the class meeeting, please feel free to email me or ask in class
for a dedicated appointment.
